### General comment / Technical issues

Generally this exercise went well. I haven't really encountered any major problems. The hardest part was to put all the animations together and make them more or less syncronized.


### How I would improve the experience (If I had to)

I would maybe allow an unlimited number of beers, by replacing the input range with an input number.
I would disable the order button when it is at 0.
I might change the color of the beer when it rises (with classic beer tones); and why not we may also be able to select several types of beers, which would influence the color of the beer.
